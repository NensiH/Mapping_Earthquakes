# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview:
This project uses data provided by usgs.gov to show a visual repersentation of all of the earthquakes on the planet over the last 7 days. This project was created using Javascript's leaflet and d3 libraries, mapbox's api, and geoJson data from usgs.gov. To interact with the maps API the user have to visit mapbox.com, create a Mapbox account and retrieve the access token.



## Purpose:
An interactive map of earthquake data, showing the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes across the world, we are creating an interactive map that shows the latest earthquake activity around the world as well.

## Resources:

- **Data Source:**

   - [USGS All Earthquakes in the Last 7 Days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)

   - [Tectonic Plates Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)

   - [USGS Earthquake with > 4.5 Magnitude in the Last 7 Days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)

- **Software:**
   - VS Code, Chrome Developer Tools
- **Languages:**
   - JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 3
- **Dependencies:**
   - APIs, Leaflet.js, Mapbox, GeoJSON data

## Results:

The final map shows the following:

1. The earthquake data and tectonic plate data
2. The earthquake and tectonic plate data are displayed when the page loads and the datasets can be toggled on or off
3. All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the all maps of the webpage
